Compose GraphQL objects with JSON definitions

**Currently Developing**

### FAQ
**Q**: Why do I need to pass a `graphql` instance to `graphql-factory`
**A**: There is a known issue with running multiple versions of `graphql` in the same project. By passing in the version your project is already using we eliminate multiple version issues.
